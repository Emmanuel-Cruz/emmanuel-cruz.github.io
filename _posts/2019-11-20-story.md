<h3>Let There Be Light!</h3>
<p>As the first post, let me make this an easy one. I think often about things, and oftentimes I wish I shared more of these thoughts with the world. Therefor, here we are. I too draw often and enjoy creating art on the edge of math and science. I enjoy enigmas, contradictions, 'head-scratchers', philosophy, and empty danger. Empty danger is when it may seem that something dangerous is occuring, but using some information that only the audience can see, the only person who feels in danger is the person going through it. Those are the best.<br>
I really like making quick comics too that provoke thought. Enough talk, time for the future, time for art, time for math, time for science!!!</p>

{% highlight ruby %}
# We have code too!
def print_hi(name):
  print("Hi, {}".format(name))
  inspiration = name+' is amazing'
  return inspiration

print_hi('The person reading this')
