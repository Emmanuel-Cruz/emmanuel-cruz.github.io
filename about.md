      <h2>Join The University of South Florida</h2>
      <p>Moved from New Jersey to Tampa Florida for a four year Bachelors of Science in Chemistry. Made great friends, and joined Alpha Sigma Phi fraternity.</p>

      <h2>Biochemistry Research: Cai Lab</h2>
      <p>Under Jainfeng Cai I began researching peptidomimetics, the science of having artificial proteins 'mimic' real ones. Our peptides were being used to treat cancer and Alzheimer's disease.</p>

      <h2>Switched Labs to Leahy Group</h2>
      <p>I fell in love with the Leahy group, and their research in cannabinoids. Cannabinoids are naturally occuring molecules which are normally found in the cannabis plant. In the Leahy group, I was able to help further the research of Tetrahydrocannabinol &Delta; 9 (THC &Delta; 9) and cannabidiol (CBD), their pharmacokinetics, dynamics, and synthesis.</p>

      <h2>Dual Research, with Gulick Lab</h2>
      <p>The research on cannabinoids began with my interest in addiction. To learn more about the neuroscience of addiction and influence of cannabinoids on the brain, I researched dually with the Gulick group. In this process, I made fascinating connections between the starkly different fields of chemistry and neuroscience/biology. All the while, I was swimming in interest applying chemical knowledge to biological lab techniques.</p>

      <h2>Accident turns into Research Position</h2>
      <p>While submitting nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) samples on the novel THC analogs I was creating in Leahy group, I forgot how to calibrate the number of scans. I asked the only other person in the room for help, turning out to be the head of the NMR department. He was furious I did not know how, then banned my account until I passed his own test. After passing his test, I expressed my interest to learning more about NMR, physics, and the robotics which powered our intruments. This lead to me researching in three groups, primarily focused on my Leahy work.</p>

      <h2>Graduation, eyes ahead</h2>
      <p>My experiences in chemistry, neuroscience, and physics gave me the same conclusion: technology will power the future of research. Addiction is my primary concern to cure and prevent in society, and I saw the power that technology has to boost addiction research, therapeutic drug discovery, and monitor behavior. I spelled these same reasons in my application to Cornell Tech University, where I was graciously admitted for a Master's degree in Computer Science.</p>

      <h2>Cornell Tech, HedonX, NeuralPositive</h2>
            <p>It takes hustle in New York City to make something happen, with the help of Cornell Tech I have been trained in the art of team making, networking, and company formation. This year all this will be put to the test. My team and I have formed HedonX, an addiction prevention company. Meanwhile, I am working as a developer for another Startup here at Cornell Tech, Neural Positive, a targeting music therapy company. I graduate in May, 2019 and will pursue these dreams, apply to positions in Quantum Computing, and do whatever it takes to help further the good in the world.</p>
