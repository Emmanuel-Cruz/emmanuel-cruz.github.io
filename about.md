      <h2>Joined The University of South Florida</h2>
      <p>Moved from New Jersey to Tampa Florida for a four year Bachelors of Science in Chemistry. Made great friends, and joined Alpha Sigma Phi fraternity.</p>

      <h2>Biochemistry Research: Cai Lab</h2>
      <p>Under Jainfeng Cai I began researching peptidomimetics, the science of having artificial proteins 'mimic' real ones. Our peptides were being used to treat cancer and Alzheimer's disease.</p>

      <h2>Switched Labs to Leahy Group</h2>
      <p>I fell in love with the Leahy group, and their research in cannabinoids. Cannabinoids are naturally occuring molecules which are normally found in the cannabis plant. In the Leahy group, I was able to help further the research of Tetrahydrocannabinol &Delta; 9 (THC &Delta; 9) and cannabidiol (CBD), their pharmacokinetics, dynamics, and synthesis.</p>

      <h2>Dual Research, with Gulick Lab</h2>
      <p>The research on cannabinoids began with my interest in addiction. To learn more about the neuroscience of addiction and influence of cannabinoids on the brain, I researched dually with the Gulick group. In this process, I made fascinating connections between the starkly different fields of chemistry and neuroscience/biology. All the while, I was swimming in interest applying chemical knowledge to biological lab techniques.</p>

      <h2>Accident turns into Research Position</h2>
      <p>While submitting nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) samples on the novel THC analogs I was creating in Leahy group, I forgot how to calibrate the number of scans. I asked the only other person in the room for help, turning out to be the head of the NMR department. He was furious I did not know how, then banned my account until I passed his own test. After passing his test, I expressed my interest to learning more about NMR, physics, and the robotics which powered our intruments. This lead to me researching in three groups, primarily focused on my Leahy work.</p>

      <h2>Graduation, eyes ahead</h2>
      <p>My experiences in chemistry, neuroscience, and physics gave me the same conclusion: technology will power the future of research. Addiction is my primary concern to cure and prevent in society, and I saw the power that technology has to boost addiction research, therapeutic drug discovery, and monitor behavior. I spelled these same reasons in my application to Cornell Tech University, where I was graciously admitted for a Master's degree in Computer Science.</p>

      <h2>Cornell Tech, HedonX, NeuralPositive</h2>
            <p>It takes hustle in New York City to make something happen, with the help of Cornell Tech I have been trained in the art of team making, networking, and company formation. This year all this will be put to the test. My team and I have formed HedonX, an addiction prevention company. Meanwhile, I am working as a developer for another Startup here at Cornell Tech, Neural Positive, a targeting music therapy company. I graduate in May, 2019 and will pursue these dreams, apply to positions in Quantum Computing, and do whatever it takes to help further the good in the world.</p>

      <h2>Cornell Tech, A2A, and Drug Discovery</h2>
            <p>And put to the test I was. HedonX began as an experiment, how can technology revolutionize addiction treatment? We conducted hundreds of interviews, with Executives, Social Workers, Clinicians, Rehabilitation facility directors, and most importantly, people. Across many efforts and disciplines, we poured everything into that question. Slowly, barriers came and went, but the ultimate boundary confronted me: Cornell Tech is a learning experience. It seemed to give me a large advantage and at the same time a large disadvantage. With the "work like a real startup" matra of David Tisch bellowing in class is a contradiction to what faculty will tell you. There were restrictions of what we can and cannot do, see other section for more.<br> As important lessons of leadership were pouring in from the ceiling, I was falling in love with Deep Learning algorithms, Networks and Markets, and other ways of modeling then solving problems with computer science. And it really was science. Come late May, I found myself in  Florida celebrating my brothers graduation from Law School. A few days later, my graduation from Cornell took place, and I found myself spiralling into the next set of life's choices. I had always told myself, that the first real job I get I want it to be something I can study as if it was a PhD. Thanks to NYLifeSci initiative, I was spotted by a phenomenal company known as A2A Pharmaceuticals. They took me on as at first an intern, then, their 5th full time hire, and put me to work to build toxicity models for in-silico drug screening. A task I was already in love with, I am one of the lucky ones who gets to use all their life skills and carve the future of drug discovery.</p>

      <h2>A2A & A Better Future</h2>
            <p>In September I accepted the full-time offer to continue building technology I was fascinated by. The complexity of drug discovery is unnerving, and it comes with an entire set of rules and quantum controversies that turn any classification problem into a full research position. This stuff is amazing! Over the past few months, I was trained in computational modeling for drug discovery simultaneously while constructing AI technologies to make the computational team's life easier. Now, with the cool title I get with a small company, I am using all tools, old and new, to lead our company's KRAS program against cancer. Practice makes perfect, and the other day I had a dream that my old organic chemistry II professor spoke of. Flying around the protein crystal structure, imagining molecules fitting inside, seeing the interactions. There is a massive future with A2A Pharma, and I look forward to helping them in any way I can. We put therapeutics first, patients first, and that is what I see my future to contribute to.</p>
